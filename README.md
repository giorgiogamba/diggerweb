# diggerweb

This project is the web version of my previous "digger" application. It is a project that I am using to learn some React.js and some Python backend, since it is a topic that I don't usually use at my current job. 

The project will permit users to make some researches inside the Discogs DB using some "smart" parameter, that I would like to have when browsin the application. In addition, I would like to give the users some possiiblity to make faster eresearches on other websites that djs commonly use, like decks.de etc.
